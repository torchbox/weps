## Abstract

This RFC presents a vision for Wagtail for the next two years. It should help align the work on Wagtail through a better shared understanding of direction, help us to prepare a roadmap of work, and help us to prioritise the big pieces of work.

We're obsessed with making Wagtail easy to build, maintain and customise. Speed of development is crucial for our community.
